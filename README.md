# Random-password-generator
This code implies a vary of different characters such as, Capital letters, lowercase letters, special characters and numbers. Starting from the left it goes Capital letters, 
Numbers, speical characters and lowercase letters. Once you pick a box it will present you with a line of code within the guide lines of what box you checked. If you click the 
generate password box mutiple times it will constantly provide a different password for you.

What I learned doing this assingment - I thought you could make one array to corrispond with both values and characterstics but soon found out one will overide the other and the
code will not work at all.
